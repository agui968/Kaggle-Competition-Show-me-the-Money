# Kaggle-Competition-Show-me-the-Money
[Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/enseame-la-pastala-batalla-analtica-bancaria/) to predict who should be granted a loan and who should not.

For these classification ML models, I had to balance both classes in order to train the model properly, as well as filling the null values and trying several models in order to get the best ROC AUC score.

Thanks to these techniques, I got the second place ðŸ¥ˆ in this competition.
